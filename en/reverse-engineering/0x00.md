# CPU

CPU has two major components; 

1. Control unit: is responsible for retrieving individual instructions from their location in memory, the translating them into commands that the CPU can understand. 
2. Execution unit: is responsible for performing the third step of the instruction cycle, namely, executing, or performing the operation that was specified by the instruction. 

## Execution Unit 

- The execution unit itself is made up

RAM is 100x slower than the RAM, so if each instruction on the CPU want to access a piece of memory, the CPU would be 100x slower than it can be. So for every instruction that CPU had to use ninety nine cycles just to get the data from the RAM and run it. 

To fix that, we use caches. Caches are temporary memories where they store a chunk of data coming from the RAM.

## Length of Data 

- BIT: The smallest memory unit which can store only 0 and 1. 
- BYTE: It consists of 8 bits and the smallest meaningful memory unit which can store 0 to 255 (FF in hexadecimal numeral system). 
- WORD: It is a combination of 2 bytes or 16 bits. 
- DWORD: It is a double word value, or has 32 bits.
- QWORD: It consists of 4 words (quad word) or has 64 bits.

## Numeral Systems 

There are three famous number systems in computer science. 

- Binary: is a base 2 system and has two symbols, 0 and 1. 
- Decimal: is the base 10 system most widely used today and uses 0,1,2,...,9. 
- Hexadecimal: is a base 16 system and uses digits from 0..9 and A..F. A hexadecimal (shortly hex) number is usually represented by 0x as prefix (0x12AB) or h as suffix (12ABh).

## Process Registers
 
The registers are like variables built in the processor. Using registers instead of memory to store values makes the process faster and cleaner. 

There are several types of registers, but the most important ones in reversing are: 
- General registers 
- Segment registers
- Indexes and pointers
- EFLAGS register
